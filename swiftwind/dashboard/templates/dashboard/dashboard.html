<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
    Balance this month: {{ net_total }}
</p>

<p>
    Bank balance: {{ bank_balance }}
</p>

<h3>Housemate Income</h3>

<p>
    This is money which has been paid to us by housemates.
    The aim should be to get these accounts to zero by transferring money
    to the relevant expense or stockpile accounts.
</p>

<table>
    {% for account in housemate_accounts %}
        <tr>
            <td>
                {{ account.name }}
            </td>
            <td>
                {{ account.balance }}
            </td>
        </tr>
    {% empty %}
        <tr>
            <td>
                No housemate accounts
            </td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>

<p>
    Total: {{ housemate_accounts.net_balance }}
</p>

<h3>Other Income</h3>

<p>
    This is money which has been received from elsewhere.
    The aim should be to get these accounts to zero. You can do this
    but putting it towards this month's expenses, or towards the stockpile.
    You could also save it for a rainy day by moving it to Retained Earnings.
</p>

<table>
    {% for account in other_income_accounts %}
        <tr>
            <td>
                {{ account.name }}
            </td>
            <td>
                {{ account.balance }}
            </td>
        </tr>
    {% empty %}
        <tr>
            <td>
                No additional income accounts
            </td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>

<p>
    Total: {{ other_income_accounts.net_balance }}
</p>

<h3>Expenses - money we <em>have</em> spent</h3>

<p>
    Amounts below are things we have <em>already</em> spent money on.
    The aim should be to get these accounts to be zero by
    transferring money in from the income accounts.
</p>

<table>
    {% for account in expense_accounts %}
        <tr>
            <td>
                {{ account.name }}
            </td>
            <td>
                {{ account.balance }}
            </td>
        </tr>
    {% empty %}
        <tr>
            <td>
                No expense accounts
            </td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>

<p>
    Total: {{ expense_accounts.net_balance }}
</p>

<h3>Stockpile - money we <em>will</em> spend</h3>

<p>
    This is money we are saving up because we know we are going to have to pay it in the future.
    When we eventually pay a bill it will come out of an expense account (because it will then
    be money we <em>have</em> spent). At which point we transfer the relevant stockpile
    into the expense account, thereby returning both to zero. Congratuations on planning for the
    future.
</p>

<table>
    {% for account in current_liability_accounts %}
        <tr>
            <td>
                {{ account.name }}
            </td>
            <td>
                {{ account.balance }}
            </td>
        </tr>
    {% empty %}
        <tr>
            <td>
                No accounts
            </td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>

<p>
    Total: {{ current_liability_accounts.net_balance }}
</p>

<h3>Long-term debts</h3>

<p>
    Sometimes we may have long-term debts, such as loans from housemates.
    These don't need to be worried about from month-to-month.
</p>

<table>
    {% for account in long_term_liability_accounts %}
        <tr>
            <td>
                {{ account.name }}
            </td>
            <td>
                {{ account.balance }}
            </td>
        </tr>
    {% empty %}
        <tr>
            <td>
                No long-term debts
            </td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>

<p>
Total: {{ long_term_liability_accounts.net_balance }}
</p>

<h3>Long-term money - rainy day fund</h3>

<p>
    Sometimes we end up with more money than we need. In which case we place
    it into the 'Retained Earnings' account. It is money the house has earnt,
    and it is retained until a later date when we may choose to spend it.
</p>

<p>
    Retained Earnings: {{ retained_earnings_balance }}
</p>
